        <section class="post-content">
            <p>If you are planning to settle in UK, the Life in the UK Test is going
to be one of the most difficult exams you will come across.
This computer-based test is just of forty-five minutes and has only 24 questions.
However, the applicant needs to score 75 percent in the exam in order to pass it.</p>

<p>The questions are related to the history, government, and culture of UK.
The most difficult of all is the history section of this test.
It is very important for the applicant to prepare well for this exam, because otherwise,
the dream of UK Settlement might even remain a dream.</p>

<p>Since the price of this exam is also very high, the applicants do not find
it comfortable in giving the test multiple times, if they do not clear it.
You must not think that since the numbers of attempts are unlimited for this test, you can give it repeatedly.
You must prepare well at once and then give your exam.</p>

<p>When you apply for the test, you get an official handbook from which the questions usually come.
If you are referring to books outside that, you must make sure that they are certified and
do not have unnecessary or vague questions in it.
There are several websites as well which provide you the practice material.
You should always make sure you consult a user friendly, registered website, which helps you pass the test.
When you are giving the test, you must be calm and give time to each of the questions.
Hurrying up might lead to mistakes, which reduces the chances of your qualification.
The applicants who have certain medical problems also get time extension so that they can give the test.
However, they need proof for the same.</p>

<p>It is one of the most important tests of the UK Immigration, so, you must be well prepared for the same.
There are several websites, which offer you practice papers and mock tests for this exam.
However, most of them are paid and you will have to pay some price or another to be able to
get the practice material and mock tests.
Some websites have come up which offer free mock tests to its users, www.mockthetest.com is one such website,
which comes in this category. When you are studying for this test, you must always make sure that the
interface of the website you use is user friendly and you do not have any problems in giving the tests on that.</p>
