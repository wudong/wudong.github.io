        <h1 class="post-title">Five tips to clear Life in the UK Test</h1>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Life in the UK Test is one of the most difficult thing you will ever come across if you are planning to get settled in the UK.
It is a forty-five minutes exam with twenty-four questions, but you have to answer correctly at least eighteen questions.
The preparation of the exam is tough and one has to prepare well if they want to clear the exam.
The following tips will help you prepare for the Life in The UK Test</p>

<h2>Test Easier than the Practice Book</h2>

<p>The people who have passed the Life in the UK Test have claimed that the actual exam is much easier
than what they get in the official practice book. But that does not mean you should omit some of the questions just because they are hard.
You must try to answer all the practice questions so that you are fully covered for the exam.</p>

<h2>Two answers for the Same Question</h2>

<p>There are some questions, which require you to give two answers for the question.
You should mark all the choices, which are correct instead of marking just one.
So you need to read the question carefully.</p>

<h2>Take your Time</h2>

<p>When you sit for the exam, you must not panic and try to answer the answers quickly. Forty-five minutes sound a short span,
but since you just have 24 questions to answer, it is more than sufficient.
You should give time to each question, read them carefully, think about it, and then mark the final answer.</p>

<h2>No need of a Perfect Score</h2>

<p>Many students fail in the exam because they make seven or more mistakes while trying to answer all of them correctly.
Since you are just supposed to answer 18 answers correctly, you can skip the ones you are not sure about.
This does not only waste your time, but it also increases your chances of missing the ones you know.</p>

<h2>English Vocabulary</h2>

<p>When you are preparing for the Life in the UK Test, you must pay special attention to your English vocabulary.
There are times people get confused between the words they are being asked about and this often leads to mistakes.</p>

<p>If you keep the above-mentioned points in mind while preparing for the Life in the UK Test,
you are most likely to score well in it and get your UK Settlement as soon as possible.</p>
