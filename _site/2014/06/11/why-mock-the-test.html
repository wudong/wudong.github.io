            <p>This is a personal retrospection of why and how I develop the website. If you are not interested in knowing the tech stuff,
or how this website comes to exists, you can steer clear, no offense taken :)</p>

<p>As with most of the users of this website, I need to take the Life in the UK test.
Unfortunately for me, I cannot find a decent website that can provide what I wanted for preparing the test. Surely there
are plenty out there, but mostly they just give out questions for the exam;
not easy to use (at least not in my standard), fully spammed with advertisement, and lacking some vital functions.
In the end, I just stick with the book, giving up my search on a usable website.</p>

<p>I still passed the exam in the end, as I delighted to show off in the <a href="life-in-the-uk-test.html">post</a>.
However, it still bothered me that I didn&#39;t find anything that satisfy my need, which is pretty rare in this digital age.
Plus Helen is going to take the test pretty soon, I hope I can do something for her on this regard. So I decided
to develop a website that dedicate the test. In the initial concept, the website should have these functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>A test simulator that closely resemble the real test; this is mainly on the interface design;</li>
<li>A test practise that can practise with all the questions; However, it should be more than just displaying the question
and answer in a predefined order. It need to be more intelligent to remember what user has done and display
the questions accordingly; That is to say, the questions will be prioritied based on user&#39;s past performance.</li>
<li>An evaluator to show the user his progress on the preparing, and whether he is good enough to take on the real test;</li>
</ul>

<p>To begin with, I am not really a web developer; although I think I am familiar with the web tech stuff,
I have never developed a website. This actually make the developing more interesting. When choosing the framework,
I firstly rejected PHP and Java, I wanted to try something more cool, and more fashion,
the MEAN stack (Mongodb, Express, Angular.js Node.js) fits that profile well. But having a strong background in
typed languages like Java, I have put Typescript into the mix.</p>

<p>With frustration here and there, the development actually went quite well considering my limited knowledge in
the cornerstones in the stack. With two weeks spare time, I was able to show the first demo to Helen,
who is quite impressed.</p>
