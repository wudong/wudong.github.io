* Linux Memory
[[http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/server-usage/linux-check-memory-usage]]

- With ~free -m~ shows linux memory usage, displayed in MB instead of KB.
  The *free* column besides buffers/cache is the actual free memory available
  to linux

- Difference between buffers and cache
  A buffer is a temporary location to store data for a particular application
  and this data is not used by any other application. Cache is a memory location
  to store frequently used data for faster access.

- A process memory layout
