Life in the UK test is a Computer Based Test (CBT),
which means you will face a computer rather then a sheet of paper during
the test. However it is really not that much different in this specific
test we are going to talk about.

In some CBT, the question changes based on how well you perform
during the test (they are called Computer Adaptive Test, or CAT).
Each question you answer impacts the next question. In those tests,
you will not be able to go backward and review or change the answers.

Fortunately, this is not the case for the Life in the UK test.
You will presented with a set of questions and
you can navigate back and forth the question set,
just as what you can do with a paper based test.


## Question Types
The questions in the test are all in the form of **multiple choice
question**. For each question, you are
supposed to select the right answer(s) among a set of options.
If we looks into the details of those questions, they can be categorised
into four types:

#### Type 1: True or False

In this type of question, you are presented with a statement,
and need to determine the correctness of the statement
by choose True or False.

#### Type 2: Right or Wrong

In this type of question, you are given **TWO** statement
and need to select the correct one.

#### Type 3:  Single Answer

In this type of question, given the question, four answers are
given and you need pick out the right one out of the four.

#### Type 4: Two Answers

This is similar to the type 3, but instead of choosing one
correct answer, **TWO** correct answers need to be identified.

## Some Advices and Tips

### Question in doubt
The general advice for multiple-choice tests is: if in doubt,
stick with your first answer. However, this might not the best advice.

One [survey](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1986-15885-001) of
33 different studies conducted over 70 years found that, on average,
people who change their answers do better than those who donâ€™t.
In none of these studies did people get a lower score because
they changed their minds.

Many study also shows that when you change your answer in
a multiple-choice test, you are more likely to be changing
it from wrong to right than right to wrong.
So actually sticking with your first answer is, **on average,
the wrong strategy**.

### Try out the interface
Do try and get you familiar with the test interface. You can change
the colour scheme, font size, etc. to be more comfortable according to your preference.

### Use scratch paper
You will receive a supply of scratch paper before you begin the test.
You can replenish your supply of scratch paper as necessary throughout the test by asking the test administrator
Use scratch paper .. reasoning, Write down the questions that are not sure.

### Watch the time
Time generally won't be a issue, most people will . But do watch your time.

### Use your common sense
One major advantage of multi-choice question
