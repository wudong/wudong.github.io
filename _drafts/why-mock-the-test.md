title: How 'Mock the Test' came to the world.

This is a personal retrospection of why and how I develop the website. If you are not interested in knowing the tech stuff,
or how this website comes to exists, you can steer clear, no offense taken :)

As with most of the users of this website, I need to take the Life in the UK test.
Unfortunately for me, I cannot find a decent website that can provide what I wanted for preparing the test. Surely there
are plenty out there, but mostly they just give out questions for the exam;
not easy to use (at least not in my standard), fully spammed with advertisement, and lacking some vital functions.
In the end, I just stick with the book, giving up my search on a usable website.

I still passed the exam in the end, as I delighted to show off in the [post](life-in-the-uk-test.html).
However, it still bothered me that I didn't find anything that satisfy my need, which is pretty rare in this digital age.
Plus Helen is going to take the test pretty soon, I hope I can do something for her on this regard. So I decided
to develop a website that dedicate the test. In the initial concept, the website should have these functions:

* A test simulator that closely resemble the real test; this is mainly on the interface design;
* A test practise that can practise with all the questions; However, it should be more than just displaying the question
and answer in a predefined order. It need to be more intelligent to remember what user has done and display
the questions accordingly; That is to say, the questions will be prioritied based on user's past performance.
* An evaluator to show the user his progress on the preparing, and whether he is good enough to take on the real test;

To begin with, I am not really a web developer; although I think I am familiar with the web tech stuff,
I have never developed a website. This actually make the developing more interesting. When choosing the framework,
I firstly rejected PHP and Java, I wanted to try something more cool, and more fashion,
the MEAN stack (Mongodb, Express, Angular.js Node.js) fits that profile well. But having a strong background in
typed languages like Java, I have put Typescript into the mix.

With frustration here and there, the development actually went quite well considering my limited knowledge in
the cornerstones in the stack. With two weeks spare time, I was able to show the first demo to Helen,
who is quite impressed.
