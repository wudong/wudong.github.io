Will.i.am, who is a coach on BBC talent
show The Voice UK, hinted that he might want to live
in the UK permantly when intervieed by BBC News.
However, when asked some practice questions
for the Life in the UK Test,
"what is the highest denomination banknote in England?",
"That will be 100", he answered.

There are wide criticism about the test:

Previously, historical information was included in the handbook but was not tested.
 Now the book features sections on Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Viking Britain
 to give migrants an “understanding of how modern Britain has evolved”.

The inclusion of British culture and history in the test is important
that prospective citizens demonstrate awareness of Britain’s cultural narrative;
but the government goes too far in making this narrative the main subject of the test.

Migrant groups attacked the new syllabus and test as "a lampoon of Britishness"
that made citizenship harder to achieve but for the wrong reasons.

In its previous incarnation, the handbook described Margaret Thatcher as a “divisive figure” whose policies caused a “massive” industrial decline.

Now it hails her as the longest-standing 20th century Prime Minister who introduced a “number of important economic reforms”.

By contrast, Labour’s 13 years in power are given a solitary paragraph in the handbook while Gordon Brown’s premiership is described in one sentence – “Gordon Brown took over as Prime Minister in 2007”.

Too hard for most Britian(http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2008/0131/p01s05-woeu.html)

An online version of the test found Britons less knowledgeable about their own country than Poles, Finns, Swedes, or Germans. Of more than 11,000 Britons who took the mock test, only 1,585 achieved the 75 percent passing grade. The fact that few Britons could clear this last hurdle to citizenship has again raised criticism that the bar is set too high. Government data show that almost 1 in 3 people have failed the test since its introduction in November 2005.

Various courts from youth courts and beyond are mentioned, but the UK Supreme Court is left out.

It may be hard to believe, but the new test handbook requires applicants to memorize telephone numbers. There are five to know and none are 999 or 111. The five include the National Domestic Violence Helpline and the HMRC self-assessment helpline. The final three are the front offices of the House of Commons, the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament – omitting (forgetting?) the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont in Belfast.

This chapter lists the dates of birth for about 30 men, but only four women. Neither of the Queen’s birthdays is included.
