<h2 id="sec-2">The main concepts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>
<b>Messaging</b> is a technology that enables <b>high-speed</b>,
<b>asynchronous</b>, program-to-program communication with <b>reliable
delivery</b>.
</li>
<li>
<b>Channels</b>, also known as queues, are logical pathways that connect
the programs and convey messages.
</li>
<li>
<b>Sender</b> or <b>producer</b> is programs that send message by writing the
message to a channel.
</li>
<li>
<b>Receiver</b> or <b>consumer</b> is programs that receive messages by
reading (and deleting) from a channel.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Messaging System</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Messaging capabilities are typically provided by a separate software
system called <b>messaging system</b> or <b>message-oriented
middleware(MOM)</b>.
</li>
<li>A messaging system is configured with the channels that define the
paths of communication between the applications. The messaging
system then coordinates tha messages the sending the receiving of messages.
</li>
<li>Two important messaging concetps:
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> Send and forget </dt>
<dd>The sender sends the message to the message
channel and once that is complete, the sender can go on while
the messaging system transmits the message in the
background. The sender doesn't have to wait for the receiver to
receive and process the message.
</dd>
<dt> Store and forward </dt>
<dd>When the sender sends a message, the
messaging system <b>store</b> the message. It then delivers the
message by forwording it to the receiver, where it is stored
again.
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>By wrapping the data as a message and storeing it in the messaging
system, the applications <b>delegate</b> to the messaging system the
<b>responsibility</b> of delivering the data.
</li>
<li>The messaging system can act as a <b>mediator</b> - as in the Mediator
pattern - between all of the programs that can send and receive
messages. An application can use it as a <b>directory</b> of other
applications or services available to integrate with.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The messaging system can be used to provide a high number of
distributed connections to a shared resouce, such as a database.
</li>
<li>The messaging system can employ <b>redundant resources</b> to provide
high-availability, balance load, reroute around failed network
connections, and tune performance and quality of service.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Messaging system can enable <b>asynchronous communications</b> and <b>call
back</b>.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt> Complex programming model </dt>
<dd>application logic can no longer be
coded ina single method that invokes other methods, but the logic
is now split up into a number of event handlers that respond to
incoming messages.
</dd>
<dt> Sequence issue </dt>
<dd>message channels guarantee message delivery, but
not when the message will be delivered. This can
cause messages that are send in sequence to get
out of sequence.
</dd>
<dt> Synchronous scenario </dt>
<dd>not all application can operate in a
send-and-forget mode. Thus many messaging systems need to bridge
the gap between synchronous and asynchronous solutions.

<h2 id="sec-4">Distributed Applications vs Integration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An enterprise application often incorporates an n-tier architecture
enabling it to be distributed across several computers.
</li>
<li>Even through this results in processes on different machines
communicating with each other, this is application distribution, not
application integration.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The communicating parts are tightly coupled.
</li>
<li>Communication between tiers tends to be synchronous.
</li>
<li>An application (n-tier or atomic) tends to have human users that
will only accept rapid system response.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrated applications are independent applications that can each
run by itself, but coordinate with each other in a loosely coupled way.

data. and many of these system are going to have their own data
stores.

<h2 id="sec-6">Loose coupling</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The core principle behind loose coupling is to <b>reduce the
assumptions</b> two parties (components, applications, services,
programs, users) make about each other when they exchange
information.
</li>
<li>A great example of tight coupling is a local method invocation.
</li>
<li>
<b>RPC</b> or <b>RMI</b> is also considered to be <span class="underline">tightly coupled</span>.

<dt> Messages </dt>
<dd>An <b>atomic</b> packet of data that can be transmitted on a channel.
</dd>
<dt> Multi-step delivery </dt>
<dd>In the simplest case, the message system
delivers a message directly from the sender to the
reciever. However, actions often need to be performed on the
message after it is sent and before it is received by the final
receiver. A <b>Pipes and Filters</b> architecture describes how
multiple processing steps can be <b>chained</b> together using channels.
</dd>
<dt> Routing </dt>
<dd>A message may have to go through several channels to
reach its final destination. When message is send to a
<b>Message Router</b>, it will determine how to nagivate the
channel topology and direct the message to the final
receiver, or at least to the next router.
</dd>
<dt> Transformation </dt>
<dd>Variaous applications may not agree on the format
for the same conceptual data. To reconcile this,
the message must go through an intermediate
filter, a <b>Message Translator</b>.
</dd>
<dt> Endpoints </dt>
<dd>An application doesn't have some build-in capability to
interface with the messaging system. The <b>Message
Endpoint</b> is the bridge code that enable the

<h2 id="sec-10">Pipes-and-Filters</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The pipes and Filters style use abstract pipes to decouple
components from each other. The pipe allows one component to send a
message into the pipe so that it can be consumed later by another
process that is unkown to the component.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The obvious implementation for such a pipe is the <b>Message Channel</b>
</li>
<li>Most Message Channels provide language, platform and location
independence between the filters.
</li>
<li>This affords us the flexibility to move a processing step to a
different machine for dependency, maintenance or performance reasons.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One potential downsides of a Pipe and Filters architecture is the
large number of required channels.
</li>
<li id="Pipeline Processing">Connecting components with asynchronous
Message Channels allow each unit in the chain to operate in its
own thread or process. This is called <b>processing pipeline</b>
because messages flow through the filters. When compared to
strictly sequential processing, a processing pipeline can
<i><b>significantly</b> increase system throughput</i>. <br><img src="https://www.codeproject.com/KB/architecture/PipesAndFilters/image002.jpg" alt="image002.jpg">
</li>
<li id="Parallel processing">With the pipeline processing, the overall
system throughput is limited by the slowest process in the
chain. To improve throughput we can deploy multiple parallel
instance of that process to improve throughput.
</li>
<li>Pipes and Filters share some similarities with the concept of
Communicating Sequential Processes(CSPs)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The basic mechanism underlying CSPs is the synchronization of two
processes via input-output(I/O).
</li>
<li>I/O occurs when process A indicates that it is ready to output to
process B and process B states that it is ready to input from
process A.
</li>
<li>If one of these happens without the other being true, the process
is put on a wait queue until the other process is ready.

<div id="outline-container-sec-11" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-11">Message Router</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Message based integration solutions deals with individual messages
which are not necessarily associated with a single, larger
dataset. <b>As a result</b>, individual messages are more likely to
require <b>different</b> series of processing steps.
</li>
<li>Message Channel decouples the sender and the recevier of a
Message. <b>As a result</b>, a message channel can contain messages from
different sources that may have to be treated differently based on
the type of message, or other criteria.
</li>
<li>Decouple individual processing steps so that messages can be passed
to different filters depending on a set of condition.
</li>
<li>Message Fouter differs from mthe most basic notion of Pipes and
Filters in that it connects to multiple outpue channels.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The components surrounding the Message Router are completely
unaware of the existence of a Message Router.
</li>
<li>A key property of the Message Router is that it does not modify
the message content.
</li>
<li>Only conerns itself with the destination of the message.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the intent of a Message Router is to decouple filters, it can
actually cause the opposite effect.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Message Router needs to have knowledge of all possible message
destination in order to send the message to the correct channel.
</li>
<li>If the destination change frequently, it turn the Message Router
into a <b>maintaince bottleneck</b>.
</li>
<li>In this case it would be better to let the individual recipients
to decide which message they are interested in.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Message Router requires the insertion of an additional processing
step, it can degrade performance.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can cause computational overhead if the message itself doesn't
really change.
</li>
<li>Could turn a Message Router into a <b>performance bottleneck</b>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deliberate use of Message Routers can turn the advantage of loose
coupling into a disavantage.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Make it difficul to understand the big picture of the solution.
</li>
<li>This is common problem with messaging solutions and the use of
routers can exacerbate the problem.
