** Data Pre-processing
- Logistic regression / neural networks work on numerical vectors, not
  categories.
- One-hot encoding, to change a categories to  numerical values:
  For example, Time of day is a category of 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, it can be
  encoded as:
  | 12am-6am | 6am-12pm | 12pm-6pm | 6pm-12am |
  |----------+----------+----------+----------|
  |        1 |        0 |        0 |        0 |
  |        0 |        1 |        0 |        0 |
  |        0 |        0 |        1 |        0 |
  |        0 |        0 |        0 |        1 |
  Having a 1 for each column.
- Binary categories don't need 2 columns for "true" and "false". Just
  absorb the "false" into the bias term.
- Numerical columns: \\
  Simple way to normalization (0 mean, 1 standard deviation): minus
  the mean and devided by the deviation.
