* Concurrency Design Pattern

** Active Object
- The active object design pattern decouples method execution from
  method invocation for objects that each reside in their own thread
  of control.
- The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method
  invocation and a scheduler for handling requests.

* Architectural Pattern
** Naked objects


* Architectural Style

** Layered Architecture

** Hexagonal Architecture.

** Onion Architecture
