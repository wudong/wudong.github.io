So I have passed the **Life in the UK Test**, oh yeah! But to be fair, it is quite simple;
I have prepared for the worse.

People (my solicitor especially) are saying that even native Britons wont be able to pass the Life
in the UK Test without preparation, which I kinda of agree. After all, who on earth would try to remember
 _where did Henry VIII's fifth wife come from?_
But with some time studying and remembering, it become fairly simple.

I guess The government has no intention to
train each immigrant to be [egghead](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006z736),
or drive away every possible candidates!
The 40 minutes test took me 15 minutes to finish with double check,
and hesitating whether to do a triple check to make the **Â£50** test fee more worthwhile.

In retrospective, although the test in general can be defined as 'piece of cake',
I wish I could have better ways preparing it -- reading books is never fun for me, let
along reading one that filled with pretty much unrelated facts. Most people
passing the test say it would be enough to just finished the question book. That
is most likely to be true according to my experience, although nobody can be certain.

I then did a google and  I was amazed at the sheer number of the websites.
It is a quite competitive niche!
However, almost all the websites are static sites that full of all kinda of strange questions
and advertises. Usability wise, it is in a way, worth than the book, which _make me quite sad_.

The sadness left me think if I can do better. Although I am not really
a website person, I had always wanted to do something; now it might be finally a good reason.
**I wanted to see if I can take a different approach and achieve better results than
the general websites alike**, and get some experience on how a website
really work (i.e., make money).
With that passionate thought and a few sleepless weekends (I do have a proper day job unfortunately)
the website [Life UK Test](http://www.testlifeinuk.com) comes to life.

I accidentally implemented it in a way that other people have coined a name for it: [MEAN](http://mean.io).
**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **A**ngular, **N**ode all happen to use javascript and seems perfectly matched
for small scale web applications. I could feel the sheer speed of development comparing to
traditional web stack like JSP/Servlet or even PHP. I feels that if I had enough experience
to start with, it will only take a few days full time to implement the website.

Wife is pretty much happy with it, I am pretty much happy with it, then I found
I have hit a brick wall: google does not want to rank me, despite all the fancy
tricks I have put in and the fact that the website is built with [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/),
a framework from Google!
This simply means **No One** will ever to be able to dig it out and use it.

I then tried a few SEO tricks like [pre-rendering the page](http://prerender.io), setting up a
[facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/testlifeinuk), posting on some forums, etc. Will that make much
difference? I guess it did, a bit. From google analytics it does show some traffic
from those sources, but it is really quite minimal. In total, it is about 20 visits, 200 pageviews per day.
Not sure what that will leave me..
What makes me happy is that the [bounce rate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate) is really low,
which means people do like to use when they find it.

So in the end, after all the efforts, it is more or less a failed project. But I do learn a lot; I shall
write more posts in the near future to summarise these hard-earned lessons.
Next time, will I do things differently? Maybe, maybe not, Cause I really like
the way it is currently implemented.
Maybe next time google is smart enough to figure it is a good website :)
